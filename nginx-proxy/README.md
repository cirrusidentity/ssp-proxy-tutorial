# Docker Proxy

It can be challenging to run multiple docker images that want to listen on port 80 or 443.
Docker needs each container to use different ports - this can conflict with testing IdPs or SPs locally since the metadata contains port information.
An HTTP proxy can solve this issue: the proxy listens on port 80 and 443 and proxies the connection to our other containers.

See more details and options for the proxy here: https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/

*remember* On Mac OS X and Windows, docker can't mount your file system - only stuff in /Users/[username]. So if you want to use volumes, make sure they are on that path

## SSL
You should use `https` for your services but this makes it harder to proxy.  Currently we use the nginx proxy with a self-signed cert, and you'll need to accept the browser warnings.


### Let's Encrypt

There are also several certificate that were generated with Let's Encrypt.
To renew these certificates we'll use the DNS challenge since the hostnames route to private IPs.
The hostnames to create certs for are in `certs/letsencrypt/domains.txt`

```bash
# Run dehydrate with a lexicon script to automatically generate certs.
# The way to indicate to Lexicon that we are using a delegated zone is hackish - we stick it infront of the provider name
# Also we use our own starting script - because the docker image doesn't include boto3 so we install it.
AWSKEY='abc'
AWSTOKEN='xyz
docker run -it --rm \
  --name dehydrated \
  -e 'EMAIL=patrick@cirrusidentity.com' \
  -e 'PROVIDER=--delegated stack-dev.cirrusidentity.com route53' \
  -e LEXICON_ROUTE53_USERNAME=$AWSKEY' \
  -e LEXICON_ROUTE53_TOKEN=$AWSTOKEN \
  -v $PWD/certs/letsencrypt:/letsencrypt/ \
  mlaihk/docker-dehydrated-lexicon \
  /letsencrypt/run.sh
```

After the above runs you'll have a bunch of `certs` and `keys`. We need to move them and name them what the `nginx-proxy` expects.

```bash
while read domain; do
  echo "Moving cert for $domain";
  cp certs/letsencrypt/certs/$domain/privkey.pem certs/$domain.key
  cp certs/letsencrypt/certs/$domain/cert.pem certs/$domain.crt
done < certs/letsencrypt/domains.txt
```


## Run Proxy

Use the below syntax to run the proxy with tls support

```
docker run --name nginx-proxy -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v $PWD/certs:/etc/nginx/certs -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy
```

## Run a Proxialble Container

There are a couple of secrets for running the containers that will get
proxied by nginx. These settings should be applied to the proxied
container, and not to the nginx image.

### Set VHOST name

nginx will look at the VIRTUAL_HOST environment variable in your
container to know which host names should be forwared where.  You will
then need to make sure (with /etc/hosts) that the VIRTUAL_HOST name
gets resolved to your docker instance (`docker-machine ip default`).

Note: VIRTUAL_HOST supports multiple values and wildcards. Example: `foo.bar.com,baz.bar.com,bar.com`

### SSL

If you want:

* 80 -> 80 proxying: This is the default
* 443 -> 80 proxying: Add `CERT_NAME=default` as an environmental variabled to your container
* 443 -> 80 proxying: Add `CERT_NAME=default`, `VIRTUAL_PORT=443` and `VIRTUAL_PROTO=https`

`CERT_NAME` maps to the mounted certs from the `certs` directory.

### Sample

This runs an image as the host `sample-sp.ci-local.com` on random
ports. The nginx container detects these ports, and introsepcts the
environmental variables and sees the proxy should listen on 443 and
forward connections to the container. The DNS record
`*.docker.testm.es` resolves to ` 192.168.99.100` (the most common
docker-machine ip).

    docker run -d -P \
      --name sample-sp-proxy \
      -e VIRTUAL_HOST=sample-sp.docker.testm.es \
      -e CERT_NAME=default \
      -e VIRTUAL_PORT=443 \
      -e VIRTUAL_PROTO=https \
      cirrusid/ssp-base:1.14.3


And you can view the logs with

    docker logs -f sample-sp-proxy

And visit the site in your browser at
`https://sample-sp.docker.testm.es/simplesaml`. Currently the proxy
uses a self-signed cert, so you must ignore the warnings.
